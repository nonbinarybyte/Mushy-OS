# Rust Kernel.

Just a random kernel made in rust, that will (*hopefully*) become an Operating System.

<hr>

Im using this as my project to learn rust, and before i'm yelled at

**YES, THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA I'M AWARE!!!**

## The Plan.

So my plan is to learn rust, but thats too small of a plan, it needs to be BIGGER. The main goal here is to learn rust & make literally anything I want, so heres the plan in a list.

<hr>

  1. Read The Documentation.
  2. Code a "Hello World" project in the terminal.
  3. learn how to compile & execute rust code.
  4. get my VM to work.
  5. Make the OS starting with the bootloaders. 
     1. aarch64
     2. arm
  6. Test it by making it say "Hello World" on boot. (in a VM, again if it works.)
  7. Make the Kernel.
     1. Test it in the VM.
  8. Get the input/output to work.
     1. test in the VM.
  9. Allocate storage & space (will probably happen earlier idk yet.)
     1.  Test.
  10. File system setup.
  11. Userspace
      1.  Graphics.
      2.  App(s).
          1.  Terminal
          2.  File Viewer
          3.  Settings
          4.  **& MORE**
      3.  Basic Terminal w/ Commands.
      4.  GUI's
      5.  **& MORE**

## Goals.

- Be *halfway finished* by 03/14/2026 (14/03/2026 for non-americans)
  - That means be at (or complete) step ***7***
- Make apps within a timely manner; i will give myself 1.5 months per app.
- have 3 apps complete by 01/10/2027 (10/01/2027 for non-americans)
