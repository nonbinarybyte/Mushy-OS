## Version 1.0-Beta

What is version 1.0-Beta?
***v.1.0-B*** *(short for "version 1.0-Beta")* is the FIRST BETA version of Mushy OS! It's in active development as we speak. v.1.0-B is the original plan for this silly little **O**perating **S**ystem (OS). This is only made to run in a VM (Virtual Machine) as this isnt stable enough to run as the Host OS *(and probably isnt safe enough to either)*. Either way, this is just a for fun project.

## Features.

The features I plan on adding **IN THE FUTURE**

  - Built-In (mini?)games
    - Built in either C or Python
  - FastFetch type thing for the terminal.
  - Built-In apps.
    - Such as: Terminal, Libre Office suite, Firefox (the best browser.), VSC, Files app, & clone of ADOBE PDF stuff for linux :3.
  - Theming ability (inda like KDE but better.)

Features that I need to add.

  - Basic functionality.
    - Wifi, Bluetooth, Creating a `.txt` file, & Log in system.

Current Features

~~It turns on, thats all that matters!!~~

## Do I plan on having this being a main stream OS?

ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOT LMAO, if this does become popular i would actually scream and cry and throw a tantrum.
